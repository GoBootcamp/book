# Concurrency
\label{cha:concurrency}

Concurrent programming is a large topic but it's also one of the most
interesting aspects of the Go language.

Concurrent programming in many environments is made difficult by the subtleties required to implement correct access to shared variables. Go encourages a different approach in which shared values are passed around on channels and, in fact, never actively shared by separate threads of execution. Only one goroutine has access to the value at any given time. Data races cannot occur, by design. To encourage this way of thinking we have reduced it to a slogan:

Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

This approach can be taken too far. Reference counts may be best done by putting a mutex around an integer variable, for instance. But as a high-level approach, using channels to control access makes it easier to write clear, correct programs.

Although Go's approach to concurrency originates in [Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes), it can also be seen as a type-safe generalization of Unix pipes.

## Goroutines
\label{sec:goroutines}

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

```go
go f(x, y, z)
```

starts a new goroutine running:

```go
f(x, y, z)
```

The evaluation of `f`, `x`, `y`, and `z` happens in the current goroutine and the execution of `f` happens in the new goroutine.

Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized. The [sync](http://golang.org/pkg/sync/) package provides useful primitives, although you won't need them much in Go as there are other primitives.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
```

## Channels
\label{sec:channels}

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, `<-`.

```go
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
```

(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

Like maps (Section~\ref{sec:maps}) and slices (Section~\ref{sec:slices}), channels must be created before use:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
```

By default, sends and receives block wait until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(a []int, c chan int) {
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range a {
		sum += v
	}
	c <- sum // send sum to c
}

func main() {
	a := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

	c := make(chan int)
	go sum(a[:len(a)/2], c)
	go sum(a[len(a)/2:], c)
	x, y := <-c, <-c // receive from c

	fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}
```

[Go tour page](http://tour.golang.org/#66)

### Buffered channels

Channels can be _buffered_. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to `make` to initialize a buffered channel:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    c := make(chan int, 2)
    c <- 1
    c <- 2
    fmt.Println(<-c)
    fmt.Println(<-c)
}
```

[See in playground](http://play.golang.org/p/o52Ur8W4gE)


But if you do:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 2)
	c <- 1
	c <- 2
	c <- 3
	fmt.Println(<-c)
	fmt.Println(<-c)
	fmt.Println(<-c)
}
```

[See in playground](http://play.golang.org/p/eczbew4bL8)

You are getting a deadlock:

```
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
```

That's because we overfilled the buffer without letting the code a
chance to read/remove a value from the channel.

However, this version using a goroutine would work fine:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 2)
	c <- 1
	c <- 2
	c3 := func() { c <- 3 }
	go c3()
	fmt.Println(<-c)
	fmt.Println(<-c)
    fmt.Println(<-c)
}
```

[See in playground](http://play.golang.org/p/YKg79QtX2q)

The reason is that we are adding an extra value from inside a go
routine, so our code doesn't block the main thread. The goroutine
is being called before the channel is being emptied, but that is fine,
the goroutine will wait until the channel is available.
We then read a first value from the channel, which frees a spot and
our goroutine can push its value to the channel.

## Range and close
\label{sec:range_close}

A sender can close a channel to indicate that no more values will be sent. Receivers can test whether a channel has been closed by assigning a second parameter to the receive expression: after

```go
v, ok := <-ch
```

`ok` is false if there are no more values to receive and the channel is closed.

The loop `for i := range ch`  receives values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed.

**Note:** Only the sender should close a channel, never the receiver. Sending on a closed channel will cause a panic.

**Another note:** Channels aren't like files; you don't usually need to close them. Closing is only necessary when the receiver must be told there are no more values coming, such as to terminate a range loop.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
    x, y := 0, 1
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        c <- x
        x, y = y, x+y
    }
    close(c)
}

func main() {
    c := make(chan int, 10)
    go fibonacci(cap(c), c)
    for i := range c {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```

## Select
\label{sec:select}

The `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.

A `select` blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func fibonacci(c, quit chan int) {
    x, y := 0, 1
    for {
        select {
        case c <- x:
            x, y = y, x+y
        case <-quit:
            fmt.Println("quit")
            return
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    c := make(chan int)
    quit := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            fmt.Println(<-c)
        }
        quit <- 0
    }()
    fibonacci(c, quit)
}
```

[See in playground](http://play.golang.org/p/uf94rfXkva)

### Default case

The default case in a `select` is run if no other case is ready.

Use a `default` case to try a send or receive without blocking:

```go
select {
case i := <-c:
    // use i
default:
    // receiving from c would block
}
```

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    tick := time.Tick(100 * time.Millisecond)
    boom := time.After(500 * time.Millisecond)
    for {
        select {
        case <-tick:
            fmt.Println("tick.")
        case <-boom:
            fmt.Println("BOOM!")
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("    .")
            time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}
```

### Timeout

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	response := make(chan *http.Response, 1)
	errors := make(chan *error)

	go func() {
		resp, err := http.Get("http://matt.aimonetti.net/")
		if err != nil {
			errors <- &err
		}
		response <- resp
	}()
	for {
		select {
		case r := <-response:
			fmt.Printf("%s", r.Body)
			return
		case err := <-errors:
			log.Fatal(err)
		case <-time.After(200 * time.Millisecond):
			fmt.Printf("Timed out!")
			return
		}
	}
}
```

[See in playground](http://play.golang.org/p/JGHVPCFNGm) but note that
in playground, you won't get a response due to sandboxing.

We are using the `time.After` call as a timeout measure to exit if the
request didn't give a response within 200ms.

## Exercise: Equivalent Binary Trees
\label{sec:exercise_equiv_bin_trees}

[Online Assignment](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/8)

There can be many different binary trees with the same sequence of values stored at the leaves. For example, here are two binary trees storing the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

![](images/tree_ex_1.png)


A function to check whether two binary trees store the same sequence is quite complex in most languages. We'll use Go's concurrency and channels to write a simple solution.

This example uses the `tree` package, which defines the type:

```go
type Tree struct {
    Left  *Tree
    Value int
    Right *Tree
}
```

1. Implement the Walk function.

2. Test the Walk function.

The function `tree.New(k)` constructs a randomly-structured binary tree holding the values `k`, `2k`, `3k`, ..., `10k`.

Create a new channel `ch` and kick off the walker:

```go
go Walk(tree.New(1), ch)
```

Then read and print 10 values from the channel. It should be the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `10`.

3. Implement the Same function using `Walk` to determine whether `t1` and `t2` store the same values.

4. Test the `Same` function.

`Same(tree.New(1), tree.New(1))` should return `true`, and `Same(tree.New(1), tree.New(2))` should return `false`.

### Solution

If you print `tree.New(1)` you will see the following tree:

```
((((1 (2)) 3 (4)) 5 ((6) 7 ((8) 9))) 10)
```

To implement the `Walk` function, we need two things:

* walk each side of the tree and print the values

* close the channel so the `range` call isn't stuck.

We need to set a recursive call and for that, we are defining a
non-exported `recWalk` function, the function walks the left side first,
then pushes the value to the channel and then walks the right side.
This allows our range to get the values in the right order.
Once all branches have been walked, we can close the channel to indicate
to the range that the walking is over.

```go
package main

import (
	"code.google.com/p/go-tour/tree"
	"fmt"
)

// Walk walks the tree t sending all values
// from the tree to the channel ch.
func Walk(t *tree.Tree, ch chan int) {
	recWalk(t, ch)
	// closing the channel so range can finish
	close(ch)
}

// recWalk walks recursively through the tree and push values to the channel
// at each recursion
func recWalk(t *tree.Tree, ch chan int) {
	if t != nil {
		// send the left part of the tree to be iterated over first
		recWalk(t.Left, ch)
		// push the value to the channel
		ch <- t.Value
		// send the right part of the tree to be iterated over last
		recWalk(t.Right, ch)
	}
}

// Same determines whether the trees
// t1 and t2 contain the same values.
func Same(t1, t2 *tree.Tree) bool {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)
	go Walk(t1, ch1)
	go Walk(t2, ch2)

	for {
		x1, ok1 := <-ch1
		x2, ok2 := <-ch2
		switch {
		case ok1 != ok2:
			// not the same size
			return false
		case !ok1:
			// both channels are empty
			return true
		case x1 != x2:
			// elements are different
			return false
		default:
			// keep iterating
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)
	go Walk(tree.New(1), ch)
	for v := range ch {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
	fmt.Println(Same(tree.New(1), tree.New(1)))
	fmt.Println(Same(tree.New(1), tree.New(2)))
}
```

The comparison of the two trees is trivial once we know how to extract
the values of each tree. We just need to loop through the first tree
(via the channel),
read the value, get the value from the second channel (walking the
second tree) and compare the two values.
