#Get Your Feet Wet
\label{cha:get_your_feet_wet}

One of the best way to learn technical skills is to actually dive in
as soon as we have acquired the basics.

The following code was written by someone who just started learning Go. Beginners often make the same mistakes so assume that this is your code and you are now tasked to refactor it. The end goal is to create a CLI to interface with the Pivotal Tracker API.

Fork the project as explained in the [readme](https://github.com/GoBootcamp/clirescue/blob/master/README.md)

Find a one or more people and work with them to see how you would
address this refactoring. Time to rescue this project!
